                <h2>Hi! My name is Caillou Leigh-Smith and I am a junior Software-Engineer/Developer.</h2>
                <p>I started my journey at the young age of 12 - young, i know - where I first started to learn the 'language' scratch.</p>
                <p>As time progressed, I moved onto learning web development (html, css & js), where I finally began understanding the importance of it all!</p>
                <p>Before I knew it, I was emailing my brother local directory links to my HTML webpages.. yes, i seriosuly did that.. </p>
                <p>As the years passed, I progressed onto languages such as Python, C#, in depth Js, TypeScript. Along the journey I started learning some frameworks, both front and back-end.</p> 
                <br>
                <h3>Enough about tech..</h3>
                <p>Outside the world of tech (that exists?), I am a lover for fitness and health. Keeping in shape has helped me progress mentally and physically, which has had a huge impact on my ability to write code and problem solve!</p>
                <p>Lifting weights and running occupies a lot of my free time! but without it, I wouldn't be as much of a well-rounded individual!</p>
                <p>I thrive in communication-based environments. Aka, I love people, I love understanding individuals, and seeing things from new/fresh perspectives.</p>
